tracking:
  - git init # Intializing git repository.
  - git status # Checking the status of files in local and remote repo.
  - touch .gitignore # Creating ".gitignore" file and then putting file names in there, which won't be tracked.
  - git add <file_name> | . | -A | # "." adds current working directory files/dirs, "-A" adds all, doesn't matter which dir you are on the working directory.
  - git restore --staged <filename> # Removing files from staging area.
  - git restore <filename> # Discard changes to unstaged file in working directory. Basically same as "git checkout <file_name>".
  - git checkout <file_name> # Undoing changes to unstaged file in working directory.
  - git commit -m <message> # commiting files to the git repository.
  - git commit --amend -m <message> # Changing a bad commit message that is accidently happened, it also changes the commit hash. Try only if commits are not pushed to remote or it will cause conflicts.
  - git commit --amend # Adding newly staged changes to last commit without making a new commit, but it does changes the commit hash.
  - git cherry-pick <commit_hash> | <commit_hash> <commit_hash> # Taking one or two commits from a different branch and applying the same changes to the current branch rather than merging whole branch. Yes, it is also changes the commit hash/hashes.
  - git reset <commit_hash> # Moves the current branch HEAD to specific commit also removes all the previous staged files.
  - git reset --soft <commit_hash> # Moves the current branch HEAD to specific commit but remains the previously staged files.
  - git reset --hard <commit_hash> # Moves the current branch HEAD to specific commit also removes all the changes that are made.
  - git revert <commit_hash> # It makes a new commit by undoing a specific commit that has passed to it as argument.
  - git rm --cached <file_name> # Stop tracking a file in the working directory, but keep it in the file system.
  - git clean -df # Removing untracked directories and files from the working directory.
  - git reflog # Sort of a garbage collection of the commits. The many times HEAD has changed through all the branches. Life-Saver **
  - git log # Checking the previous commits with commit hashes.
  - git log --oneline # Checking the previous commits with commit hashes in short format.
  - git diff # shows defference between previous and new change to the repo that hasn't added to the staging area.
  - git diff <file_name> # shows defference between previous and new change to specific file that hasn't added to the staging area.
  - git diff --cached <file_name> # shows defference between last commit and new changes.
  - git diff <commit_hash> # shows defference between previous and new change to the files in specific commit timeline.
  - git init --bare # initializing this command on remote directory to make the dir as bare repo.
  - git remote add origin <path> # adding local repo into remote location.
  - git remote remove origin # removing remote location from the local repo.
  - git push -u origin <branch_name> # pushing a new local branch into remote repository for the first time. "-u" stands for upstream.
  - git push origin <branch_name> # pushing changes into remote repository branch.
  - git fetch --all # fetching changes from remote repo to local.
  - git pull origin <branch_name> # checking remote repository branch, if it is updated.
  - git clone </path/repo_name> # cloning a repository from remote location.
  - git remote -v # checking information about remote location of the repository.
  - git branch # lists all of the local branches.
  - git branch -a # checking all the branches that are local and remote.
  - git branch <name> # create new branch.
  - git checkout <branch_name> # checking out in new branch.
  - git checkout -b <branch_name> # creating and checking out in new branch at the same time.
  - git checkout <origin/branch_name> # to take a quick peek at an upstream branch, check it out directly.
  - git checkout <remote_branch_name> # creating local branch from remote branch to work with it.
  - git branch --merged # Checking out if there is any branch merged with the master.
  - git merge <branch_name> # merging branch with the master.
  - git branch -d <branch_name> # to delete a local branch.
  - git push origin -d <branch_name> # to delete a branch from remote.

  - rm -f .git/index.lock | .git/ORIG_HEAD.lock # if there is an error because of index or ORIG_HEAD .lock file.
