# AWS Services

IAM(Identity and Access Management):
  - IAM is a Global Service.
  - Groups only contains users, not other groups.
  - ARN stands for amazon resource name.
  - Always give users minimum amount of access required to do their jobs.
  - Create groups and attach them to users, this is the best practice.

  Roles:
    - Role is an identity in IAM that has specific permissions.
    - Roles are temporary which is preferred option for security purpose.
    - Roles provide access without the access key IDs and secret access keys by attaching it to ec2. This is the preferred method.
    - Policies control a role's permissions.



S3(Simple Storage Solution):
  - Can be use to store static data like text file, image file, videos, any file type but not Operating System or use as Databases.
  - Total volume of data and number of objects is unlimited in S3.
  - Objects can be maximum at 5TB in size.
  - S3 Bucket is similar to folder in storage system. All AWS accounts share the S3 namespace. Each S3 namespace is globally unique.
  - S3 stores data as a key-value pair system. File name will be key and files data will be the value.
  - S3 Bucket also has a version ID which is important for storing multiple version of a project.
  - Metadata which is data about the data that is stored in S3 Bucket. (i.e. content-type, last-modified)


  Securing Data with S3 Block Public Access:
    - S3 Buckets are private by default (including all objects within it). Buckets has to allow public access on both bucket and its objects in order to make the bucket public.
    - Individual objects can be public by using Object ACLs.
    - Entire bucket can be public using S3 bucket policy.
    - S3 scales automatically with demand.


  S3 Versioning:
    - All versions of objects are stored in S3. This includes all writes even deleted objects. Once enabled cannot be disabled. Only suspend is allowed.
    - It is a great backup tool.
    - Can be integrated with lifecycle rules.
    - Multi Factor Authentication supports for securing data.


  S3 Classes:
    S3 Standard Options:
      - S3 Standard
      - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
      - S3 Standard One Zone-Infrequent Access
      - S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    S3 Glacier Options:
      - Glacier Instant Retrieval
      - Glacier Flexible Retrieval
      - Glacier Deep Archive


  Life Cycle Management:
    - Automate moving of objects between different storage tiers.
    - Can be used in conjunction with versioning.
    - Can be applied to current version as well as previous versions.


  S3 Objects Lock and Glacier Vault Lock:
    
    S3 Objects Lock:
      - S3 Object Lock, uses to store objects using write once, read many (WORM) model.
      - S3 Object Lock, can be used in a individual objects or across the bucket as a whole.
      
      - S3 Object Lock, comes with two modes (governance mode and compliance mode):
        - Governance Mode - Users can't overwrite or delete and object version or alter it's lock settings unless they have special permissions.
        - Compliance Mode - A protected object version cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user account in AWS.

    S3 Glacier Vault Lock:
      - S3 Glacier Vault Lock helps you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. You can specify controls such as "write once read many" (WORM) in a Vault Lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, policy can no longer be changed.


  S3 Ecncryption:
    Encryption in transit:
      - SSL/TLS
      - HTTPS

    Encryption at REST:
      Server Side Encryption:
        - SSE-S3 (AES 256-bit)
        - SSE-KMS (KMS Managed Keys)
        - SSE-C (Customer Managed)

      Client Side Encryption:
        - User enforce to encrypt files before uploading to S3.

      Enforcing Encryption with a Bucket Policy:
        - A bucket policy can deny all PUT request that don't include x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header.


  S3 Performance:
    - Prefix - bucketname/folder/subfolder/file.txt > /folder/subfolder
    - 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD request per second, per prefix.
    - More prefix means more speed, if there is 2 prefixes achieving object request will be 11000 per second.
    - Objects that are encrypted in S3 with SSE-KMS has limit to uploading/downloading objects. It is region specific, it's either 5500, 10000 or 30000 request per second.
    - Multipart uploads for uploading files to increase performance. Should be used for any files that is over 100 MB, required for file over 5 GB.
    - Use S3 byte-range fetches to download files from S3 for increase perfromance.


  S3 Replication:
    - Replicate objects from one bucket to another. Supported for both cross region and same region replication.
    - Objects in a existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
    - Delete markers are not replicated by default. But can be turn that on as an option.



EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud):
  - https://instances.vantage.sh/ (EC2 Instance Info)


  Ports Info:
    - 22 SSH (Secure Shell) - For login into Linux.
    - 21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files into file file share.
    - 22 SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files using SSH.

    - 443 HTTPS - Access secured website.
    - 3389 RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log into a windows instance.


  EC2 Purchasing Options:
    - On-Demand Instances - short time workload, testing, predictable pricing, pay by hour or second, depending on the type of instance. Without paying any upfront.

    - Reserved Instances (1 & 3 years) - Application with steady state or predictable usage or application that require reserved capacity. Make upfront to reduce compute cost. Up to 72% discount on hourly charge. Reserved instances can be scheduled for a time and it is regional.

      - Standard Reserved Instances - Long workloads, up to 72% off on-demand price.
    
      - Convertible Reserved Instances - Long workloads with flexible instances, up to 54% off on-demand price. Has ability to change reserved instances type greater or equal value.

    - Spot Instances - Short workloads with urgent capacity, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable). Use cases high performance computing, big data analytics, CI/CD pipeline, containerized. Can't be used in persistent workloads, databases or in critical jobs. Save upto 90%. For terminating persistent spot request user have to go and cancel the spot request first then terminate the instances. A "Spot Fleet" is a collection of "Spot Instances" and (optionally) "On-Demand Instances". Spot Fleet will try and match the target capacity with the price restraints, can be configured with multiple pools. You can block spot instances from terminating by using "Spot Block".
  
    - Dedicated Hosts
      - Compliance - Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
      - Licensing - Greate for licensing that doesn't support multi-tanant or cloud deployment.
      - On-Demand - Can be purchase for on-demand (hourly).
      - Reserved - Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.


  Security Groups and Bootstrap scripts:
    - Security groups are virtual firewall for ec2 instances. By default, everything is blocked.
    - All inbound traffic is blocked and outbound traffic is allowed in by default.
    - Security groups can be attached to multiple instances also instances can have multiple groups attached to it.
    - Security groups live outside the EC2 instances.
    - Security groups are stateful.
    - User data is bootstrap scripts.
    - Bootstrap scripts runs at instance boot time and it has root level permission. It passes user data to ec2 instance. Can be use to install applications like web servers and database.
    - Meta data is data about data, in this case it is data about the ec2 instances.
    - Bootstrap scripts aka "user data" can be use to access metadata.


  EC2 Networking:
    - ENI (Elastic Network Interface) - For basic, day to day networking.
    - EN (Enhanced Networking) - Uses single root i/o virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance. Depending on instance type, Enhanced Networking can be enabled using
      - ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) - Supports network speeds upto 100 Gbps for supported instance types.
      - VF (Intel 82599 Virtual Function Interface) - Supports network speeds upto 10 Gbps for supported instance types. Typically used on older instances.
    - EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter) - accelerates high performance computing (HPC) using os-bypass and machine learning applications.


  EC2 Placement Group:
    - Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (e.g., compute optimized, GPU, memory optimized, storage optimized).
    - AWS recommends homogenous instances within cluster placement groups.
    - Placement group merging is not allowed.
    - To move a existing instance to placement group first the instance need to be in stopped state. Moving and removing instances using AWS CLI or AWS SDKs but not available via console yet.

      - Cluster - Grouping of instances with a single availability zone. Recommended for applications that need low latency or high network throughput or both.

      - Spread - Spread placement group is a group of instances that each placed on distinct underlying hardware. Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.

      - Partition - Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. e.g., Hbase, HDFS, Cassandra.


  vCenter and VMware:
    - vCenter can be deplyed into AWS cloud using VMware.
    - vCenter on AWS allows you to extend your private cloud to the AWS cloud.

  
  Outposts:
    - extending AWS into data center this is where outposts comes in.
    - AWS outposts racks for large deployment.
    - AWS servers for smaller deployments.



EBS (Elastic Block Store) & EFS (Elastic File System):

  EBS Volume Types:
    - Storage volumes that can attach to ec2 instances.
    - Automatically replicated within a single availability zone to protect against hardware failure.
    - Designed for mission critical data like production workloads.
    - Dynamically increase capacity and change the volume type with no downtime or performance impact in live system.


    - SSD(Solid State Disk):

      - General Purpose SSD (gp2):
        - 3 IOPS per GiB, upto maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume.
        - gp2 volumes smaller than 1 TB can burst upto 3,000 IOPS.

      - Cold HDD (sc1):
        - Maximum throughput of 250 MB/s per volume.
        - Less frequently access data. A good choice for colder data requiring less scans per day.
        - This is the lowest cost volume.
        - Cannot be a boot volume.


  Volumes and Snapshots:
    - Volumes exist on EBS where Snapshots exist on S3.
    - Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of the volumes and are incremental in nature.
    - Fisrt snapshot will take some time to create. For consistent snapshot, stop the instance and detach the volume.
    - Snapshots can be shared between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first it needs to be copied in target region.
    - EBS volumes can be resized in the fly as well as changing of the volume types.


  AMIs EBS vs Instance Store:
    - Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage.
    - Both EBS volume and instance store can be rebooted without losing data.
    - Instance store cannot be stopped, if the underlying hardware fails then the data will be lost.
    - By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volume there is a option to tell AWS to keeps the volume after instance termination.
    - An AMI is just a blueprint for EC2 instance.



  Volume Encryption:

    Encrypted Volumes:
      - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
      - All data in flight moving between the instance and volume is encrypted.
      - All snapshots are encrypted.
      - All volumes created from snapshots are encrypted.

    Encrypt Voumes:
      - Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.
      - Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encryption option.
      - Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot.
      - Use the AMI to launch the new encrypted instance.


  EC2 Hibernation:
    - Preserves the in-memory (RAM) data on persistent storage (EBS).
    - Much faster in boot up because there is no need to reload the operating system.
    - Instance RAM must be less than 150 GB.
    - Instance families include C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, M5, R3, R4 and R5 (CMR Group).
    - Available for Windows, Amazon Linux 2 AMI and Ubuntu.
    - Instances can't be hibernated for more than 60 days.
    - Available for On-Demand instances and Reserved instances.


  Elastic File System(EFS):
    - Highly scalable shared storage using NFS.
    - Supports the Network File System version 4(NFSv4) protocol.
    - Only pay for the storage that in use (no pre-provisioned required).
    - Can scale upto petabytes.
    - Supports thousands of concurrent NFS connection.
    - Data is stored accross multiple AZs within a region.
    - Read after write consistency.


  FSx:
    - Centralized storage solution across multiple AZs for Windows as well as for Linux.

    EFS:
      - Distributed, highly resilient storage for linux instances and linux-based application.

    Amazon FSx for Windows:
      - Centralized storage for windows-based application, such as Active Directory, Sharepoint, Microsoft SQL Server, Workspaces, IIS Web Server or any other native Microsoft application.

    Amazon FSx for Lustre:
      - High-speed, high-capacity distributed storage. This will be for application that do high performance computing (HPC), financial modeling etc. FSx for lustre can store data directly on S3.


  AWS Backup: 
      - Use AWS Backup to backup AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, EFS, FSx for Lustre, FSx for windows file server and Storage Gateway.
      - AWS Organisation can be conjunctioned with AWS Backup to backup different AWS services across multiple AWS accounts.
      - Backup gives centralized control, by automating backups and defining life cycle policies for data. To get better compliance, enforcing backup policies, ensuring backups are encrypted and audit them once they are completed.



Databases:
  
  RDS:
    - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and Amazon Aurora are RDS type database.
    - RDS is for OLTP works. Great for processing small transactions, like customer orders, banking transactions, payments and booking systems.
    - Not suitable for OLAP. Use Redshift for data warehousing and OLAP tasks. Like analyzing large amount of data, reporting and sales forecasting.

    Multi-AZ:
      - An exact copy of production database in another Availability Zone.
      - Used for disaster recovery.
      - In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically failover to the stand by instance.

    Read Replica:
      - A read only copy of the primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ or cross-region.
      - Use to increase or scale read performance.
      - Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off to primary database for read-only workloads (e.g., Business Intelligence reporting jobs).
      - Automatic backup must be enabled in order to deploy a read replica.
      - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB allow upto 5 read replicas to each DB instance.


    Amazon Aurora:
      - 2 copies of data in each availability zone, with a minimum of 3 availability zone which makes it 6 copies of data.
      - 3 types of replicas available >> Aurora replicas, MySQL replicas and PostgreSQL replicas. Automated failover is only available with Aurora replicas.
      - Aurora has automated backup turned-on by default. Snapshots can be taken with Aurora and share with other AWS accounts.
      - Aurora serverless use for simple, cost effective option for infrequent intermittent or unpredictable workloads.


    Dynamo DB:
      - Stored on SSD storage.
      - Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers.
      - Eventually consistent reads (default). Consistency across all copies of data is reached within a second. Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data. Best read performance.
      - Strongly consistent reads. A strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful repsonse prior to the end.

      Dynamo DB Transactions:
        - ACID requirement is the task for Dynamo DB Transactions.
        - Dynamo DB Transactions provide developers atomocity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account and region.
        - All-or-nothing transactions.

      On-demand Backup and Restore:
        - Full backups at any time.
        - Zero impact on table performance or availability.
        - Consistent within seconds and retained until deleted.
        - Operates within same region as the source table.

      Point-in-time Recovery (PITR):
        - Protects against accidental writes or deletes.
        - Restore to any point in the last 35 days.
        - Incremental backups.
        - Not enabled by default.
        - Latest restorable - 5 minutes in the past.

      Dynamo DB Streams and Global Tables:
        - Managed multi-master and multi-region replication.
          - Globally distributed application.
          - based on Dynamo DB streams.
          - Multi-region redundency for disaster recovery or high availability.
          - No application re-writes.
          - Replication latency under 1 second.

      
    Document DB:
      - Migrating Mongo DB from on-premises to AWS, use case will be Amazon Document DB.

    
    AWS Keyspaces:
      - Migrating big data Cassandra cluster to AWS, use case will be AWS Keyspaces.


    Neptune:
      - Migrating graph databases, use cases will be Neptune.

      - Migrating immutable database, use cases will be QLDB.


    Timestream:
      - Store large amount of time-series data for analysis, use cases is Timestream.
  


VPC:
  - VPC is a logical data center in AWS.
  - Consists of internet gateways (virtual private gateways), route tables, network access control lists, subnets and security groups.
  - 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone.
  

  NAT Gateways:
    - A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service that instances in private subnets can use to connect to services in other VPCs, on-premises networks, or the internet.
    - Redundent inside the availability zone.
    - Starts at 5 Gbps and scales currently to 45 Gbps.
    - No need to patch.
    - Not associate with security groups.
    - Automatically assigned a public IP address.
    - If there is resources in multiple availability zone and they share a NAT gateway. In the event NAT gateways zone is down, resource in other availability zone will lose internet access.
    - To create a availability zone-independent architecture, create NAT gateway in each availability zone and configure routing to ensure resources use the NAT gateway in the same availability zone.
    

    Network ACLs:
      - VPC automatically comes with a default network ACL, by default it allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
      - By default custom network ACLs denies all inbound and outbound traffic untill rules are added.
      - Each subnet in VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If not explicitly associated with a network ACL, the subnet will automatically associate with the default netowork ACL.
      - IP addresses are blocked by the network ACL not security groups.
      - Network ACLs can be associate with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with a only 1 ACL at a time. When a new network ACL attached to a subnet the previous association is removed.
      - Network ACLs are numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule.
      - Netwrok ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
      - Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for the outbound traffic (and vice versa).


    VPC Endpoints:
      - AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoints allow you to privately connect your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to other AWS services without requiring internet access. They provide secure and efficient communication between your VPC and AWS services, improving security, performance, and compliance.
      - Use cases will be AWS services without leaving the amazon internal network.
      - 2 types of VPC Endpoints, interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.
      - Gateways endpoints only supports S3 and DynamoDB.


    VPC Peering:
      - Allows 1 VPC to connect another via direct network route using private IP addresses.
      - Transitive peering is not supported. This must always be in a hub-and-spoke model.
      - Peer between regions is available.
      - No overlapping CIDR address ranges.


    AWS PrivateLink:
      - Peering VPCs to tens, hundreds or thousands of customer VPCs.
      - Doesn't require VPC peering; no route tables, NAT Gateways, Internet Gateways etc.
      - Requires Network Load balancer on Service VPC and ENI on the customer VPC.


    AWS VPN CloudHub:
      - If there is multiple sites, each with its own VPN connection. AWS VPN CloudHub can be use to connect those sites together. It's similar to VPC peering in that it works on a hub-and-spoke model.
      - AWS VPN CloudHub is low cost and easy to manage. Though it operates over the public internet. All traffic between the customer gateway and AWS VPN CloudHub is encrypted.


    Direct Connect:
      - Direct Connect directly connects data centers to AWS.
      - Useful for high-throughput workloads (e.g., lots of network traffic)
      - Helpful when need a stable and reliable secure connection.


    Transit Gateway:
      - In use of Transit Gateway route tables can be use to limit how VPCs talk one to another.
      - Works with Direct Connect as well as VPN connections.
      - Supports IP multicast (not supported by any other AWS services).


    AWS Wavelength:
      - 5G increasing application speeds at the edge using mobile networks.


    
Route 53:
  - Understand the difference between an alias and a CName record. Given the choice alwasy choose alias record over CName.
  - Commond DNS record types - SOA record, CName record, NS record, A record.
  - Domain names can be bought directly with AWS. It can take upto 3 days to register depending on the circumstances.
  - 7 available routing policies with Route 53. Simple, Weighted, Failover, Geolocation, Geoproximity, Latency and Multivalue Routing Policy.


  Health Checks:
    - Health checks can be attached with individual record sets.
    - If a record set fails health check, it will be removed from Route 53 untill it passes the health check.
    - SNS notification can be applied to alert about failed health checks.

  
  Simple Routing Policy:
    - With simple routing policy, one record with multiple IP addresses. If multiple values are specified in the record, Route 53 returns all values to the user in a random order.
  

  Weighted Routing Policy:
    - Certain amount of traffic into a individual region with percent, that is where weighted routing policy comes in.


  Latency Routing Policy:
    - Depending on the latency on client-server user will send to the lowest latency region.


  Failover Routing Policy:
    - If active site fails then Route 53 automaticlly sends user to the passive site.


  Geolocation routing policy:
    - Route traffic based on the location of the users. Geolocation routing sends clients to the specific region.


  Geoproximity routing policy:
    - Lets Route 53 traffic route to resources based on the geographic location of the users and resources.
    - Optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, knows as a bias.
    - To use geoproximity routing, will have to use route 53 "tarffic flow".


  Multivalue answer routing policy:
    - Mutltiple records with multiple IP addresses with health check option. redirects users to healthy location if any location is unhealthy.



Elastic Load Balancers:

  Application Load Balancers (Network Layer 7):
    - A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that are configured.
    - Rules determine how the load balancer routes the requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions and one or more conditions.
    - Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as ec2 instances, using the protocol and port number as specified.
    - Application load balancer only support HTTP and HTTPS.
    - to use HTTPS there must be one SSL/TLS server certificate on the load balancer. The load balancer uses server certificate to terminate the frontend connection and decrypt requests from the clients before sending them to the targets.


    Network Load Balancers (Network Layer 4):
      - Use cases, where need extreme performance.
      - Needed where protocols are not supported by Application Load Balancers.
      - Network Load Balancers can decrypt traffic by installing the certificate on the server.


    Classic Load Balancers (Network Layer 4/7):
      - 504 error means the gateway has timed out. The application is not responding within the idle timeout period. Basically the web server or the database server is down.
      - To check the clients IPv4 address use case X-Forwarded-For header.

      
    Sticky Sessions:
      - Sticky sessions enable user to stick the same ec2 instance. Can be useful if storing data locally to that instance. Disable sticky session if that specific instance is removed from the pool.
      - Sticky sessions can be used in Application Load Balancers but the traffic will be sent at the target group level.


    Deregistration Delay/Connection Draining:
      - Enabled Deregistratin delay keep existing connection open if the ec2 instance become unhealthy.
      - Disable Deregistration Delay if the connection needs to close immediately to the instances that are de-registered or become unhealthy.



Monitoring:

  CloudWatch:
    - CloudWatch is the main tool for anything alarm related.
    - Not everything go through CloudWatch but AWS standard should be watched by AWS config.
    - Standard metric is delivered every five minutes, while detail monitoring delivers data every one minute.


  Application Monitoring with CloudWatch Logs:
    - CloudWatch logs is the place for application logs. EC2, On-Premises, Lambda, RDS and CloudTrail all integrate with this service.
    - SQL query on logs goes to CloudWatch Logs Insights.
    - Realtime logs means Kinesis over CloudWatch.


  Visualizing Data and Monitoring at Scale:
    - Grafana might be best for visualization of container metrics. AWS managed service for correlation and visualization of container of IoT metrics, this might be best option.
    - Monitoring container metrics at scale? The amazon managed service for Prometheus. Leverage this service for any Kubernetes-based metrics monitoring at scale. It can be amazon EKS cluster or self-managed cluster.
    - Grafan and Prometheus both are AWS managed service. AWS handles scaling and high availability for the user.



High Availability and Scaling:

  High Availability:
    - Always keep in mind the highly available option for AWS services.
    - Appropriate situation for horizontal and vertical scaling.
    - Consider cost effectiveness.
    - Switching database in AWS is more easier than on-premise.


  Auto Scaling:
    - Auto Scaling group is only for EC2. Other services might have built-in option. But they aren't included in Auto Scaling Groups.
    - Get ahead of the workload. Whenever possible picking the solution as predictive rather than reactive.
    - Bake AMIs to reduce build times. To avoid long provisioning times by putting everything in an AMI. This is better than using user data, whenever possible.
    - Spread out. Making sure that auto scaling groups are spreaded out over multiple availabilty zones.
    - steady state groups allow to create a situation where the failure of a legacy codebase or resource that can not be scaled can automatically recover from failure.
    - Elastic Load Balancers are essential for auto scaling groups. Making sure that health checks are on, otherwise instances won't be terminated or replaced when they fail health checks.


    Database Scaling:
      - RDS has the most database scaling options.
      - Horizontal scaling is usually preferred over vertical.
      - RDS databases scales horizontally using the read replicas.
      - Dynamo DB scaling comes down to accesss patterns.
      


Decoupling Workflows:

  Amazon SQS:
    - SQS can duplicate messages. It is once in a while. So, if it is happening consistently, check for a misconfigured visibility timeout or if the developer failing to make the delete API call.
    - Queues aren't bi-directional. If there is need to return communication to the instance that sent message, then there is need a second queue.
    - Understanding the default values in SQS settings.
    - Messages stored in SQS only persist up to 14 days.
    - If message ordering is important then select SQS FIFO over the Standard.


    Amazon SNS and API Gateway:

      - CloudWatch alarm is a good option for SNS.
      - Amazon API Gateway is a secure front door to external communication coming into the environment.


    AWS Batch:
      - Batch workloads that is long-running > 15 minutes will be use case for AWS Batch.
      - Workloads that are requiring queues, use case is AWS Batch.
      - Alternative solutions for AWS lambda due to runtime requirements in that case AWS Batch is the suite.

    
    Amazon MQ:
      - If there is require for managed broker service. Use case will be Amazon MQ.
      - Rabbit MQ and Active MQ these two technologies goes with amazon MQ.
      - Message protocols like JMS, AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, OpenWire or STOMP also goes with amazon MQ. SNS and SQS can not handle these message protocols.


    AWS Step Functions:
      - Serverless orchestration service will involve AWS Step Functions.
      - Whenever solutions requires different states or logic during workflows like condition checks, failure catches or specially wait periods then the use case will be AWS Step Functions.

      - Amazon AppFlow can be Bi-directional in some use cases. Data can be ingested in or out of AWS services depending on the configurations.



Big Data:

  Redshift and EMR:
    - While Redshift is a relational database, It's not a replacement for RDS in traditional application.
    - Redshift only support single-AZ deployments. Multiple clusters can be deployed in different AZs, but technically they are separate deployments. It's not highly available by default.
    - EMR is made up of EC2 instances. This can employed with standard EC2 instance cost-saving measures.


  Kinesis, Athena and Glue:

    - Any AWS API call can be a trigger to kick off EventBridge/CloudWatch Events rule to perform AWS lambda, which can even trigger any EventBridge rule. This is faster than trying to scrape from CloudTrail.


  Container and Images:
    - Container management solution that runs in AWS and on-premise consider amazon EKS or EKS Anywhere.
    - Fargate can't work alone. In order to use fargate there must be use of ECS or EKS. Fargate is not a service by itself.
    - Containers are flexible. Containers can encompass just about any workload. Generally, it's preferred to use containers rather than EC2 on the exam.
    - Container starts with a Dockerfile, build an image, upload it to a repo, and then run it on a host.
    - Amazon ECR is the AWS-managed image registry. When AWS service needed for image storage or image vulnerability scanning.

        - Import key material from user, own key management infraustructure and associate with a CMK.
        - Key material generated and used in an AWS CloudHSM cluster as the custom key store feature in AWS KMS.

      Permissions:
        - Use the key policy. Controlling access this way means the full scope of access to the CMK is define in a single document (the key policy).
        - Use IAM policies combination with key policies. Controlling access this way enables to manage all the permissions for IAM identities in IAM.
        - Use grants in combination with the key policy. Controlling access this way enables to access to the CMK in the key policy, as well as users to delegate their access to others.
